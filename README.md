Hi!

Here you can find some small HTML/CSS/JavaScript projects:
1.	Logarithm Calculator
2.	Mastermind: this is a version with letters of the popular code-breaking game Mastermind. The user tries to guess the pattern and the App gives feedback: „white“ means the letter is in the code at a different position, „black“ means the letter is in the code at the right position.
I made two versions, one using only HTML/CSS/JS and the other one using Vue. Only the Vue-Version is at the moment linked in the index-site because it shows better on small displays.
3.	Facepaintig Fun: I took the pictures some time ago and they all have different sizes, I have been playing here a little bit with the layout. 
4.	Mosaic: I find it is fun to play with patterns and symmetry. I made different sizes and different tiles, the 10x10 one is active now (this might change). I am looking forward to refactor this at some point. There is surely a better way to do it.
